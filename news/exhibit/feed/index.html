		<description><![CDATA[I have a poster of yours &quot;Life in the Vast Lane&quot; . Reading some of your words about landscape and North Dakota reminded me of why I love ND landscape. I remet one of my classmates at my 5oth high school reunion in Bismarck last year.  In the conversation I mentioned that I had your poster and she went ballistic! It turns out that the picture is of her family&#039;s farm. She wants a print to give to her third daughter, but mine is NOT for sale. I live in California and watch the ND weather in winter on the news. I don&#039;t miss the winters.  
Regards,
